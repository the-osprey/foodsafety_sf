# foodsafety_sf
Data analysis of SF food safety ratings. @source Yelp dataset, CS100 initial project idea. 

You can simply read the 'SF Food Safety Analysis.ipynb' file on github. Of course, you can also download the file and run it on your computer. 

This project walks you through much of the data science workflow, from data exploration and cleaning, to visualization, to actually developing some insights into SF's restaurant landscape. You can see things such as how restaurants do after failing inspections. Its a really interesting dataset, and there's plenty more I have in mind of doing. Check for updates!
